/*
    ABOUT: Linked List

    You can't access an element by index.

    Each element is spread in different places in memory.

    A linked list is made up of nodes.

    There is a variable called `Head` that points to the first node.

    There is a variable called Tail that points to the last node.

    Each node contains data, and a pointer to the next node.

    Each node is a heap allocated element.

    The last node contains data, and a nullptr (A pointer to nothing. 
    which indicates that this is the end of the list.)
